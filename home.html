        <div>
            <h2 class="homeh2">Cuba pre revolution</h2>
            <p class="homep">Cuba was a colonized country of spain. During their independence war america stepped in to
                help the
                cubans.
                The Americans then used this opportunity to strong arm Cuba into a neo-colonial state. Eventually
                leading to
                the dictatorship
                of batista, slavery, single crop economy and us gangster ran casino business. Real cubans were
                suffering.
            </p>

        <div>
            <h2 class="homeh2">During Revolution</h2>
            <p class="homep">
                Fidel Castro after years of planning and attempts to "legally" change the government to help
                his fellow
                cubans
                turned to armed revolution.
                His initial invasion army was small and was cut to a fraction after a disastrous landing of their boat
                The
                Grandma on the island. But there was still hope. Castro and Che Guevera survived the landing attack and
                were able to grow their force back up
                with the support of royal farmers
                and the large underground revolution network of revolutionaries. <br> The us of course did not like this
                as
                their were a lot of economic interest
                invested into cuba which they fear they would lose under a new government. The us attempted to assist
                batistas
                Military with funding, weapons, tanks
                plans and logistics. This in the end was not fruitful and Castro's revolutionary army eventually took
                control and batista fled after emptying out the
                government reserve of millions of dollars equivalent to billions today.. Not exactly setting up the new
                government for success.

            </p>
        </div>


        <div>
            <h2 class="homeh2">Post revolution</h2>
            <p class="homep"> This turn of events did not make several parties happy, including the us, slave owners
                and gangsters who
                lost
                their lucrative casino businesses.
                These three groups would and still do to this day try to destroy and undermine the new socialist
                government
                set up by castro. This includes
                but not limited to, cia funding to terrorist organizations, us military bombing, over 600
                assassination
                attempts on castro and the longest lasting
                jab. The us blockade that has put a stranglehold on Cuba's economy for the last 60 years as it is still
                in
                Place. Which has cost their economy billions. Despite all this, Cuba has had some amazing
                accomplishments. Which include, ending homelessness,
                Eradication of illiteracy, universal healthcare, World renowned medical dr programs, assisting with
                other
                revolutions such as south africa, and so much more. Viva la revolución!
